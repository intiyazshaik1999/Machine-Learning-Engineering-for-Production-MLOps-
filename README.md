# Machine-Learning-Engineering-for-Production-MLOps-

In this Specialization, I learned, how to conceptualize and maintain
integrated systems. Mastered well-established tools and methodologies to build production systems that can handle relentless evolving data and continuously run at maximum efficiency. 

I am now familiar with the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of machine learning engineering in production and are ready to level up my career by participating in the development of leading-edge AI technology and solving real-world problems.
